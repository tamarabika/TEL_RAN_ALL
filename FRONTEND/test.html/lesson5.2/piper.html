        Beneath the flashy homepages of your favorite sites lurk Hooli™ and other evil corporations out to hoard and sell your most personal data.<br><br>

What was built to be the ultimate platform for the free sharing of knowledge has turned into a money-hungry monster feasting on our privacy and freedom.<br><br>

But fear not, for Pied Piper has the answer!<br> And it’s simple:
An autonomous peer-to-peer network featuring distributed storage powered by universal compression, accelerated scheduling allocation, and end-to-end encryption.<br><br>

Put even simpler — it’s the internet, completely decentralized.
